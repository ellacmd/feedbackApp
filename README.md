## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests
- Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
- Filter suggestions by category
- Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
- Upvote product feedback requests
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- [Angular 19](https://angular.dev/) - JS Framework
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) - For styles and components




### What I learned

While building this project, I realized that the latest Angular version now includes instant edit and refresh with hot module replacement.
Before now, Angular applications refreshed on every single file change. This new update however, allows style and template changes without page refresh or state loss. This feature is somewhat similar to React's Virtual DOM and really improved the development experience for me and I look forward to an update in the future where changes to the component class don't trigger a rerender.




### Continued development

For future projects, I plan to explore Angular’s incremental hydration and server-side rendering (SSR) to compare their performance with Next.js.


## ⚠️ Warning

The backend of this project is hosted on **Render's free plan**, which may cause the server to **spin down due to inactivity**.  
As a result, **initial requests may take longer to load**. If you experience slow loading times, please wait a moment as the server starts up.
